        FIXME: this is also broken now, curly braces don't count as text anymore
        would probably also need an external scanner (or alternatively a way to de-prioritize the text rule)
        more content with { and closing } brace
        and with two { opening { and one closing? }
    </div>
    <div>
        FIXME: this is broken currently due to the way text is handled
        we want text to avoid eating the next span
        fixing this would probably need an external scanner for text/all smarty tags...
        test with {<span></span>

        this is raw text now { heheh }
